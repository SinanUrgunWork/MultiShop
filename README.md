I develop a scalable e-commerce platform using ASP.NET Core and microservices  
architecture. The project covers topics such as user authentication, API management,  
containerization, and messaging. The technologies used include ASP.NET Core,  
Ocelot (API Gateway), Identity Server (Identity Management), Docker (Container  
Management), RabbitMQ (Messaging System), SQL Server, and MongoDB (Database).  
Additionally, JSON Web Token (JWT) is utilized
